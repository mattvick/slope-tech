# Elderly monitoring

## Types of monitoring

- [Video Monitors](#video-monitors) - Passive monitoring via video feed
- [Motion Sensors](#motion-sensors) - Detect movements in to and out of different rooms 
- [Wearables](#wearables) - for more mobile seniors, remote monitoring, GPS tracking, send location information, fall detection, transmit an SOS signal in an emergency
- [Fall Monitor](#fall-monitor)
- [Inactivity Monitoring](#inactivity-monitoring) - used in hospitals and specialised nursing homes - Attached to the patient's body and monitors vital signs (pulse, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, breathing movements, etc.)
- [Monitor sleep patterns](#monitor-sleep-patterns)
- [Monitor medication usage](#monitor-medication-usage)

## Other features

- Emergency alerts
- Panic button
- Call 911 automatically in an emergency

### Video Monitors

- Passive video feed
- Baby monitor

### Motion Sensors

- detect movements into and out of different rooms
- detect a variety of movements
- detects no activity for a set time
- alerts the monitoring center

### Wearables

- for more mobile seniors
- remote monitoring
- GPS-enabled
- send location information
- transmit an SOS signal in an emergency

### Fall Monitor

### Inactivity Monitoring

- the absence of a given activity becomes a trigger to start a chain of predetermined reactions that the device is programmed for
- enable the nursing staff to be constantly aware of the patients' condition
- the systems enable the nursing staff to be constantly aware of the patients' condition

Attached to the patient's body and monitors:

- pulse
- blood oxygen saturation
- body temperature
- breathing movements
- other indicators

All the information received transmited to the monitoring station.

[Studies show](https://academic.oup.com/intqhc/article/28/4/515/2594957) that this system of monitoring patients in intensive care units or general care units and specialised nursing homes allows for optimal distribution of the workload of the nursing staff. 

Both timeliness of response and effectiveness of treatment are improved. Since inactivity monitoring and other inpatient control systems are not always sufficient, specialists are conducting surveys and research for improvements.

To summarize, in hospitals, inactivity monitoring is the part of patient control systems that helps to learn in time about the medical emergency without the patient's active signal.

### Monitor sleep patterns

### Monitor medication usage

### Monitoring station

- data from devices visualised on dashboards
- Clinicians can generate reports for medical histories and adjust treatment plans flexibly based on the dynamical change tracking
